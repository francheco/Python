<!-- 
    This line tells Django to inherit from the 'base.html' template. 
    It allows us to reuse the structure and styling defined in 'base.html'.

    This line defines a block named 'content'. 
    The content inside this block will be inserted into the corresponding block in 'base.html'.

<h1>Add Transaction</h1>
<!-- 
    This is a heading (h1) that displays "Add Transaction" at the top of the page.

<form method="post">
    <!-- 
        This starts an HTML form. The 'method="post"' attribute specifies that the form data 
        will be sent to the server using the POST method when the form is submitted.
    -->

    {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- 
        This is a Django template tag that adds a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token to the form. 
        It helps protect against CSRF attacks by ensuring that the form submission is legitimate.
    -->

    {{ form.as_p }}
    <!-- 
        This renders the form fields as paragraphs (<p> tags). 
        The 'form' variable is passed from the view and contains the fields defined in the TransactionForm.
    -->

    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Add Transaction</button>
    <!-- 
        This is a submit button. When clicked, it sends the form data to the server. 
        The 'class="btn btn-primary"' adds Bootstrap styling to make the button look nice.
