### Considerations


Please replace placeholders like <encrypted_password>, <ip_address>, <subnet_mask>, <port_number>, <community_string>, <vlan_id>, and <outband_ip_address> with your actual values. This script prompts you for the password at runtime for security

Before running the script for basic provisioning, ensure that you have performed the following manual configuration steps or checks:

# Enter configuration mode
configure

# Set the root password (replace <password> with your desired root password)
set system root-authentication plain-text-password
# After entering this command, follow the prompts to set the password.

# Configure the management interface (replace <management_ip> and <subnet_mask> with your desired management IP and subnet mask)
set interfaces me0 unit 0 family inet address <management_ip>/<subnet_mask>

# Enable SSH and define the SSH parameters
set system services ssh

# Configure SNMP settings (replace <community_string> with your desired SNMP community string)
set snmp community <community_string> authorization read-only

# Create a loopback interface for management (optional)
set interfaces lo0 unit 0 family inet address <loopback_ip>/32

# Commit the configuration changes
commit
